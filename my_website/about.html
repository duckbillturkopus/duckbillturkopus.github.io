    <h1> <font color= "orange" face="Impact" size="23">This is my about page...there's nothing here yet.</font></h1>
  <font color= "orange" face="Impact" size="23"><b1>Ever since I was six or seven years old, I’ve been in love with aviation.  I spent hours upon hours flying all types of aircraft; anything from gliders to airliners to hypersonic planes.  Over the years with Aviation Explorers and Young Eagles, I’ve had lots of exposure and experience with aviation, and I know for sure that I want to fly for a living.  If I am accepted into the Naval Academy and earn a pilot slot, it would combine my love of aviation and the love for my country; whom I would be privileged to serve.  After the Navy, I would like to pursue a career as an airline pilot or as a test pilot.  Currently I am working towards my private pilot certificate, and with twenty-seven hours logged, I plan to finish it by the end of August or September.
